# Ship-detection-in-satellite-images
The project aims to detect ships in million pixels satellite images using different object detection algorithms. This makes use of various libraries and wrappers for object detection frameworks such as UNET, YOLO, Mask R-CNN, SSD, Faster R-CNN, RETINA-NET etc which might help beginners get started with object detection and computer vision easily.
